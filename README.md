# ShipInvaders
Arthur Wollocko, CS50 2018

This is my submission for my final project for the CS50 Game Design class.
I created this entirely in Unity, using mostly my own scripts. Some scripts (noted in comments) are extended or augmented from scripts 
found on various sites online (mostly unity3d.com)

This project was amazing. I couldn't believe how much work went into creating some of the simple functionality I wanted.
I suffered incredibly from "feature creep", and just kept adding features that i thought were cool.

## Instructions
There are many scenes in the application. Please go to the IntroScene to begin the game.
*IntroScene* provides a tutorial for the game, showing the player the different elements of the game and what they are supposed to do.
I'm super proud of this scene because I think its an important part of games that many companies pass over. I created a robust system
for transitioning between locations, with dynamic text adjustment. Check it out.

*MainScene* This is where the action happens. Spawners will dynamically create enemies which will attack your little town. Protect it!

*GameOver*
